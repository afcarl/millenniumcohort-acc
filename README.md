# milleniumcohort-acc
Scripts for processing data collected with the GENEActiv accelerometer from adolescent members of the Millenium cohort study.

The scripts mainly depend on R package [GGIR](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR) and produce time series which are stored in csv files. These csv files are then used for further processing.
